# Facial-Recognition
Facial Recognition Home Security
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are modeled after the inner-workings of the visual cortex in the brain. They adjust the weights of interconnected neurons in order to best classify a set of images, which is similar to how the human brain learns. CNNs have proven effective in image recognition when run on powerful hardware. However, these models can also scale to miniature computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, which costs less than $50. In this project, my goal was to use a Raspberry Pi for facial recognition to unlock a door. To achieve this, I trained a CNN classifier using the TensorFlow machine learning framework on a dataset consisting of 485 faces. After training, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 99%. For the computer to make a prediction on a new image, a pretrained library called OpenCV is employed to detect a face in the captured image, and the CNN is used to classify the face. If the program recognizes my face, it sends a signal to a solenoid which unlocks a door. The convolutional neural network used in conjunction with OpenCV proved successful in achieving facial recognition on a Raspberry Pi.
